# GraphQL API Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a GraphQL API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React. It involves building a GraphQL schema, setting up queries and mutations, connecting to a database, and creating a front-end interface to interact with the API.

## Background

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval.
- GraphiQL is a tool used for testing GraphQL queries interactively.
- Apollo is a GraphQL client for JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand GraphQL and its advantages.
- Set up an Express server with GraphQL.
- Connect to MongoDB.
- Create GraphQL queries, mutations, and types.
- Implement a front-end using React and Apollo.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 12.x.x)
- Express, GraphQL, Apollo, and other necessary dependencies.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js.
2. Set up Express and GraphQL.
3. Install Apollo dependencies.
4. Start the server and access GraphiQL for testing.

## Project Tasks

1. Create GraphQL schema and types (TaskType and ProjectType).
2. Implement a RootQuery to retrieve tasks and projects.
3. Add type relations to link tasks to projects.
4. Implement mutations for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
5. Add pagination to the project query.
6. Create a front-end React application.
7. Build a TaskList component to display tasks.
8. Create a CreateTaskForm component to add new tasks.
9. Implement an UpdateTaskForm component for editing tasks.
10. Add a delete button to delete tasks.

## Deployment

Deploy the project as needed.
